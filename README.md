## Overview

This repository is a modified version of Cloudflare‚Äôs [remote-MCP-GitHub-OAuth demo](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/tree/main/demos/remote-mcp-github-oauth#readme), extended into a **National Parks Service Explorer**. It provides an LLM context on U.S. national parks by integrating:

- The **National Park Service API**  
- The **Recreation.gov API**  
- A **Weather API (I chose [https://www.weatherapi.com/](https://www.weatherapi.com/))**  

It runs as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on Cloudflare Workers, letting you query park overviews, trails, alerts, events, weather forecasts, and more via simple tool calls to the LLM.

## üß™ Testing
Once your server is up and running, use the [MCP Server Inspector Tool](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector)
to make sure your server can connect and show you the tools and resources it has access to. 
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

## üõú For Production 
_All of this is in the original [Cloudflare README.md](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/tree/main/demos/remote-mcp-github-oauth#readme)_  
**Cloudflare recommends creating a local and remote GitHub OAuth App:**
* For the Homepage URL, specify `https://mcp-github-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`
* For the Authorization callback URL, specify `https://mcp-github-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/callback`
* Note your Client ID and generate a Client secret and add them via Wrangler.
```bash
wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY # add any random string here e.g. openssl rand -hex 32
```
**Set up a KV namespace**
* Create the KV namespace: wrangler kv:namespace create "OAUTH_KV"
* Update the Wrangler file with the KV ID

_Check out the MCP [troubleshooting docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging)_
**Connecting to Claude Desktop Fails:**
* Most commonly due to Node incompatibility issues, use node v18.20.4+ locally and checkout [this guide](https://kyle.czajkowski.tech/blog/troubleshooting-claude-s-remote-connection-to-mcp-servers) I wrote.
